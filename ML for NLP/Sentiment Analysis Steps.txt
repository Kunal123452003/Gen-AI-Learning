Steps: 
1) Get a Dataset
2) Perform Text preprocessing Part 1:
    1. Tokenization :  Converting para to sentences then sentences to words
    2. Lowercase the words
    3. Remove the regular expression or handling regular expression
3) Text preprocessing Part 2:
    1. Stemming: converting the words to their root form ex: playing->play
    2. Lemmatization: same task but better results
    3. Removing stopwords ex: a','about','above','after','again','against', and etc
4) Converting the text/word into vectors i.e.  transforming them to the numbers or array of numbers which also carry the sematic meaning of the word/text  
    some techniques for this is  Bag of words, Tf-IDF, Word2vec, AvgWord2Vec , One hot Encoding(now np one use this for text to vec conversion)
5) ML algo for NLP
